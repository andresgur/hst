Scripts to manipulate HST data.
astro_corr.py will correct the WCS of the HST image
aperture_photometry.py is meant to retrieve physical fluxes and magntiudes from point like sources
mast.py --> Downloads observations and creates a latex table with them
aperture_correction.py --> Allows to determine the PSF aperture correction to infinity from stars in the field
